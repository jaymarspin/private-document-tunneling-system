# private-document-tunneling-system
this system allows to store to documents that allow only a few users to get a copy of the documents which can be downloaded through the system private portal.


use netbeans platform
the system also comes with email notification system
if you want to import this in your project directories make 
sure you reimport all the libraries needed in this project located 
at /dist/lib once youre done you'll still 
encounter error that says a library is not found or 
something like that you'll need to remove the broken reference in the properties
of course you have to import the database in your phpmyadmin in xampp or any mysql database software
the sql file is located in the database folder, create a database name it parish then import the sql file in there.
in the connectionDetails.java you can see there the connection function to the database of software you have to modify
a few codes there


--Happy coding
